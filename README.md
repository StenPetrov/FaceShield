# FaceShield

This is a design for a lightweight face shield, made from laser-cut clear sheet plastic and a specialized 3D-printed screw. The design is suitable for fast production and is comfortable to wear with securely held elastic band.

*THIS SHIELD HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED FOR EFFECTIVENESS BY ANY MEDICAL AUTHORITY* It does, however, have similar dimensions to many of the shields out there.

Popular [Prusa Face Shield](https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/) requires 2+ hours to 3D print, with large nozzle and high speeds. It is comfortable to wear\* due to its wide band. There are designs with narrow head band, which print much faster (15-30 min) but aren't as comfortable with the narrow band.

**WARNING:** DO NOT CUT POLYCARBONATE OR ANY CHLORINE-CONTAINING PLASTICS WITHOUT PROPER VENTILATION. THE FUMES ARE TOXIC

Sheet plastic can be polystyrene or polycarbonate\*, 0.015" to 0.030"\* in thickness and 12" (30cm) square in size. Other materials and thicknesses may be usable. The sheet should comply nicely with the curved shape but not fold freely.
PETG\* 3D-printed specialized screw can be replaced with rivets if a 3D printer is not available.
1" (25mm) elastic band, about 12" (30cm) is used to keep the face shield tight, yet comfortable.
1" rescue tape is used for the elastic band as it is readily available, non-porous and temperature resistant so it is easy to clean in a dishwasher or with bleach.

Feel free to fork or contribute in any way. Feedback is welcome.
