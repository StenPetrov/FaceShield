# FaceShield

This is a design for a lightweight face shield, made from laser-cut clear sheet plastic and a specialized 3D-printed screw. The design is suitable for fast production and is comfortable to wear.

Popular [Prusa Face Shield](https://www.prusa3d.com/covid19/) requires 2+ hours to 3D print, with large nozzle and high speeds. It is comfortable to wear\* due to its wide band. There are designs with narrow head band, which print much faster (15-20 min) but aren't as comfortable with the narrow band.

*THIS SHIELD HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED FOR EFFECTIVENESS BY ANY MEDICAL AUTHORITY* It does, however, have similar dimensions to many of the shields out there.

Sheet plastic can be polystyrene or polycarbonate\*, 0.015" to 0.030"\* in thickness and 12" (30cm) square in size. Other materials and thicknesses may be usable. The sheet should comply nicely with the curved shape but not fold freely.
PETG\* 3D-printed specialized screw can be replaced with rivets if a 3D printer is not available.
1" (25mm) elastic band, about 12" (30cm) is used to keep the face shield tight, yet comfortable.
